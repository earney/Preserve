RoadMap - 10/31/2011

0.6 - create basic storage node, meetadata node, and client, which will
      allow basic functionality needed for a basic distributed file system.

0.8 - include fault tolerance via zfec library.

1.0 - all features implemented are considered stable.

1.2 - create rebalancer/healer node which will analyse how segments are
      stored and recreates any missing/lost segments, and rebalance
      segments so that no single node contains much more than the average
      number of segments.

1.4 - remove metadata node single point of failure, by using a master-slave
      model.

1.6 - add fuse functionality so that the file system can be mounted under linux

1.8 - implement binary delta compression, so that only small segments of
      a file are changed, and not the whole file.

2.0 - all functions implemented are considered stable.

2.2 - add encryption capabilities and allow ability to remove filenames
      from metadata node and store those locally so that other
      untrusted nodes cannot read sensitive data.
